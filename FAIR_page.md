# FAIR principles 


## Lesson outcomes

* Describe FAIR principles
* Apply FAIR principles throughout research project
* List good resources for FAIR data management information

These will be achieved with written information as lesson notes + examples + exercies, practical parts 
---------------------------------------

### History

In 2014, members of the scientific community got together in a workshop called “Jointly Designing a Data Fairport” in Leiden, the Netherlands, to define the principles on how you could make your data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. These 15 principles are now called [The FAIR Principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18). The GO-FAIR organization has [annoted the principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). 

### Why FAIR?

* that 10 bn sentence. mention time spent and cost of storage are biggest 
* PHDs spend 80% of their time data munging
* more citations
* etc

### FAIR important properties
