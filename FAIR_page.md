# FAIR principles 


## Lesson outcomes

* Describe FAIR principles
* Apply FAIR principles throughout research project
* List good resources for FAIR data management information

These will be achieved with written information as lesson notes + examples + exercies, practical parts 
---------------------------------------

### History

In 2014, members of the scientific community got together in a workshop called “Jointly Designing a Data Fairport” in Leiden, the Netherlands, to define the principles on how you could make your data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. These 15 principles are now called [The FAIR Principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18). The GO-FAIR organization has [annoted the principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). 

### Why FAIR?

* that 10 bn sentence. mention time spent and cost of storage are biggest 
* PHDs spend 80% of their time data munging
* more citations
* etc

### FAIR important properties

- Not domain specific; you can apply them in any field
- FAIR principles are not rules or standards. These are guidelines, not mandatory principles.
- Data can be different levels of FAIR
- The principles emphasize machine-actionability because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data.
- FAIR ≠ Open. 
    - Open data is available without restriction. The ‘A’ in FAIR stands for ‘Accessible under well defined conditions’. There may be legitimate reasons to shield data and services generated with public funding from public access. These include personal privacy, national security, and competitiveness. The FAIR principles, although inspired by Open Science, explicitly and deliberately do not address moral and ethical issues pertaining to the openness of data. They do, however, require clarity and transparency around the conditions governing access and reuse.
